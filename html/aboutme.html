            I made were lifelong. I met so many new people and friends there and until today some of us still keep in contact today!

        <p class="text-center">Since I managed to score quite well for my N-Levels, I decided to enter Singapore Polytechnic through PFP (Polytechnic Foundation Programme) in 2022.

            go through the first year of my polytechnic life there. I even joined a CCA, which is SP Fencing. Through the CCA, I managed to meet so many
            more new people and even made more friends there!

        <h2 class="text-center">MY VALUES</h2>
        <p class="text-center">My values include being honest. </p>
        <p class="text-center">Being honest is one of my values as being honest helps to make the world a better place. It helps to make the world a better place as if people weren't honest and started lying, the world would end up like a dystopia as 
            people have made empty truths about certain things and people would start to not trust each other. I like to be honest as the feeling is right when I'm telling the truth.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">Being grateful is also one of my values. Being grateful adds positivity to my life as it helps to appreciate the present moment and acknowledge the 
            good things that we have. The way I become grateful is by writing down what I'm grateful for everyday in a journal. It helps me stay positive even when life gets hard.

        <p class="text-center">
            I'm more of an introverted guy, rather than an extroverted guy. I'm usually not very good in socialising with people and am usually very awkward around new people. However, I'll try my best to be sociable with others and be friendly towards everyone!
